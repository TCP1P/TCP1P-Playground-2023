    **Guide**:\
    This challenge requires a malicious application. \
    Make your own malicious/exploit application which you will be installing in the Virtual Android Device.

    Any submissions outside the intented solution will be considered as **INVALID**.\
    For example, these types of solution is considered as invalid:
    - Downloading the challenge APK from the remote connection
    - Reading the file that contains the flag without using any exploits
    - Breaking the device using any unintended exploits

    **Note**:\
    It might take some time for the instance to be fully initialized, please wait for approximately 5 minutes for the instance to be initialized.
    If it's already 10 minutes and you can't use the connection, stop the instance and try again.
