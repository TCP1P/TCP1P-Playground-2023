    hello i'm kazuya. I was a close friend of mizuhara chizuru back in college and i still can't accept that haidar is chizuru's legal fianc√© now. I managed to hack into chizuru's computer and also acquired her ram memory. Can you help me to see something interesting in it? I've often caught the two of them exchanging messages and smiling afterward like a couple who were dating for the first time. I really hate that.
